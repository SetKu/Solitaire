To generate and build this project, run `npm run build` in the terminal.

To start this project, run `node server.js`. You can also type `npm run start` as an alternative. This will start up the project's web server using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and let it begin accepting and responding to web traffic with the projects web files.

This project's scripting was written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a compatibility layer for JavaScript, then compiled to ES6 JavaScript, which was then minified and had its dependencies handled by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
